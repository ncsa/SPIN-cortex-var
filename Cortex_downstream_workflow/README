This workflow can be used to get more information on the calls that cortex is classifying as variants and repeats. 
In order to run the workflow, the classify calls step must be run after step6 in the main workflow is run, and a reference genome for your species should be available


Important: The directory should be the full path to where you put the downstream workflow directory

To run the workflow:
use format in the example qsub_template file


The output of this downstream workflow:
'repeats_and_vars' containing the call classification file with calls classified as errors removed 
'repeats_and_vars/fastas' with fasta files for each sample containing the repeat and variant branch sequences
'repeats_and_vars/fastas/blast_results' with an xml blastout file and a plaintext output file for each sample
'blasted_and_parsed_cortex_calls' containing tsv files for each sample with:
 	branch_name
	call_type
	cortex_quality_score
	branch_len
	branch1-branch2_len_differnce
	top_hsp	
	num_hsps
	sequence_entropy
	sequence_GC_content

Two temporary directories will be created:
	'anisimov_containers' for the anisimov launcher
	'Cortex_calls_only_sequences' used in creating the fasta files
